In this session: 51
created a new git repo and started working on roboshop-docker...

we are going to create a dockerfile, create images, run them as a container for the following.
1. mongodb
2. mysql
3. redis
4. rabbitmq
5. catalogue
6. cart 
7. shipping
8. payment
9. web

--> 1. First started with the creation mongodb
From AWS cloud take t3.medium instance and install docker in the ec2 instance.
log into the instance and the clone the roboshop-docker repository and
then build the mongo image.
commands: 
1. docker build -t mongodb:1.0 .
2. docker run -d --name mongodb mongodb:1.0 
3. docker ps 
4. docker logs mongodb 

--> 2. Secondly we started with catalogue folder creation and then created dockerfile
used node 18 image and rest is coded in the dockerfile and also added supported file. 
commands:
1. docker build -t catalogue:1.0 .
2. docker run -d --name catalogue catalogue:1.0
3. docker ps
4. docker logs catalogue 

you will get error saying MongoDB connection error 

why this error coming ? we need to know about networking

run ifconfig  command 

when we do docker inspect on both mongo and catalogue we get know that

"Gateway": "172.17.0.1",
"IPAddress": "172.17.0.3" ----> catalogue
"IPAddress": "172.17.0.2" ----> mongodb

The disadvantage here is container can't communicate with each other thriugh names
if they are using docker's default network.

There two types of newtork in docker 
1. Host Network 
2. Bridge Network

roboshop project can create its oen network, 
commands
1. docker network 
2. docker network create roboshop 
3. docker network ls 
Note: By default it is bridge network
4. then run  ifconfig
5. docker rm -f `docker ps -a -q`
Here, we removed all running contaainer and creating
back all the container in the roboshop network
6. docker run -d --name mongodb --network=roboshop mongodb:1.0 
7. docker run -d --name catalogue --network=roboshop catalogue:1.0 
8. docker inspect mongodb
9. docker inspect catalogue
10. docker logs catalogue

Now, the connection is happening through container names in the created newtork.


--> 3. After Catalogue, we have Dockerfile for the web component, 
added all the supporting files related to web 
and the pushed into the git. 
commands.
1. docker build -t web:1.0 .
2. docker run -d -p 80:80 --name web --network=roboshop web:1.0
3. docker ps 
access the ip in the browser , if the categories are not coming then

4. docker exec -it
