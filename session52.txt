Started with install of docker via shell script
with command
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ravikumar-darsi/roboshop-docker/refs/heads/main/docker-installation.sh | sudo bash

this script has docker and docker compose as well.

while doing the session 51 we got error in the payment image.
now, we are going to slove it, small change in payment.py file which is purely related to development
commands:
1. git clone
2. ls
3. for i in mongodb mysql catalogue cart user shipping payment web ; do cd $i ; docker build -t $i:1.0 . ; cd .. ; done 
4. docker network create roboshop 
5. changed from 1.0 to v1.0 
6. docker images 
7. docker compose up -d  <Make sure to create roboshop network >

changed image from node:18 node:18.19.1-alpine3.19 for cart user catalogue 
but why we changed, because to reduce the size of the image < let's before 1 GB and now 200 MB > 
then pushed the changes to git and pulled in the instance.

re run the command
1.for i in mongodb mysql catalogue cart user shipping payment web ; do cd $i ; docker build -t $i:1.0 . ; cd .. ; done 
2. docker images 
and observe the images the sizes. 

docker compose up -d 

for checking whether the container are properly working or not. 

best practices:
- use official images.
- reduce image size by using bare minimum OS like alpine, distro, core OS, etc.
- use multi stage builds 
- use dokcer volumes to persist the data
- use custom network to isolate containers from other projects. 

Docker Volumes:
--------------------------
when you remove docker container, what happens to data ?
containers are ephemeral/temporary, the data by default will be deleted.
